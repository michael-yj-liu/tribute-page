    <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Desmond Doss' life</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>1919</strong> - Born in Lynchburg, Virginia.</li>
      <li><strong>1942</strong> - Enlisted for military service despite being offered a
        deferment because of his shipyard work.</li>
      <li><strong>1942 - 1944</strong> - When Desmond joined the Army, he assumed that
        his classification as a conscientious objector would not require him to carry
        a weapon. He wanted to be an Army combat medic. However, was assigned to an
        infantry rifle company. His refusal to carry a gun caused a lot of trouble
        among his fellow soldiers. They attempted to court martial him for refusing
        a direct orderâ€”to carry a gun. But they failed to find a way to toss him out,
        and he refused to leave. He believed his duty was to obey God and serve his
        country. But it had to be in that order.</li>
      <li><strong>May 5<sup>th</sup> 1945</strong> - During the operation to capture Maeda Escarpment in
        Okinawa, Japan, also known as Hacksaw Ridge, a sudden vicious counterattack by
        the Japansese forced the American's to retreat. Desmond disobeyed those orders
        and saved the lives of 75 soldiers that day.</li>
      <li><strong>May, 1945</strong> - A few days later as the Americans slowly took Hacksaw
        Ridge Desmond was severely wounded by a grenade and sniper bullet.
      <li><strong>May 21<sup>st</sup>, 1945</strong> - Desmond was evacuated from Japan
        aboard the USS Mercy</li>
      <li><strong>October 12<sup>th</sup>, 1945</strong> - Desomond receives the Medal of Honor
        from then president, Harry S. Truman.
      <li><strong>2006</strong> - After being hospitalized for difficulty of breathing Desmond died
        at his home in Piedmont, Alabama at the age of 87.
      <li><strong>2016</strong> - The feature film, <i>Hacksaw Ridge</i>, based on Desmond's
        life is released.
